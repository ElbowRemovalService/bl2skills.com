TO ADD:
Specific Skill Changes in the Changelog
It really isn't worth it to put all the various mod pages under a folder, nor the js. 
I REAAAALLLY don't want to create bl2skills/mods and put all the mod files in it
That would be AWFUL to go through each and every file and add "../" to every single link
